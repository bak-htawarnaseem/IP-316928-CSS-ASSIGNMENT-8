        <h2>O, WESTERN DEMOCRACY!</h2>
        <p> we can stage our protest <br>
            against the butcher of Ethiopia. <br>
            we are free to hurl our slogans<br>
            into the wind:<br>
            Some crows hear what we say<br>
            and look surprised, they undertake<br>
            to carry messages into your conference<br>
            where every beak laps up<br>
            the sweetness of your words,<br>
            jabbing at your shortbread promises.<br>
            So in the dark I praise you.
        </p>
